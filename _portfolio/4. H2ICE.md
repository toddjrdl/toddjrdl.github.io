## Research Background

### Why Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engines?

While battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) receive significant attention, H₂-ICE offers unique advantages:

**Benefits of H₂-ICE**
- Leverages existing ICE manufacturing infrastructure
- Lower cost compared to fuel cell technology
- Faster refueling than battery electric vehicles
- No rare earth materials required (unlike fuel cells)
- Zero carbon emissions (only produces water and NOx)

**Technical Challenges**
- Lower volumetric energy density than gasoline
- Requires specialized fuel injection systems
- Prone to pre-ignition and knock
- NOx emission control
- Thermal efficiency optimization

## Research Objectives

1. **Enhance thermal efficiency** through optimized injection timing and quantity
2. **Reduce energy loss** during combustion process
3. **Investigate split injection strategies** unique to hydrogen fuel properties
4. **Characterize combustion behavior** with hydrogen-specific injectors

## Technical Approach

### Split Injection Strategy

**Concept**: Divide total fuel injection into multiple events to optimize mixture formation and combustion phasing

**Injection Parameters Investigated**
- **Pilot injection timing**: Early vs. late pilot injection
- **Pilot injection quantity**: 10-30% of total fuel mass
- **Main injection timing**: Relationship to piston TDC (Top Dead Center)
- **Dwell time**: Interval between pilot and main injection

**Hypothesized Benefits**
- Improved air-fuel mixing through turbulence generation
- Reduced peak combustion temperature (lower NOx)
- Better control over combustion phasing
- Mitigation of knock tendency

### Hydrogen-Specific Injector Characteristics

**Injector Technology**
- High-pressure direct injection (350+ bar)
- Fast response time (<1 ms) for precise control
- Multiple injection capability within single cycle
- Hydrogen-compatible materials (non-metallic seals)

**Key Differences from Gasoline Injectors**
- Higher injection pressure requirements
- Smaller orifice diameter due to low H₂ density
- Enhanced sealing to prevent hydrogen embrittlement
- Faster actuation for multiple injections per cycle

## Experimental Setup

### Engine Specifications
- Single-cylinder research engine
- Hydrogen direct injection (DI) configuration
- Variable compression ratio capability
- Optical access for combustion visualization

### Instrumentation
- In-cylinder pressure sensors (piezoelectric)
- Crank angle encoder (0.1° resolution)
- Exhaust gas analyzer (NOx, H₂O)
- High-speed imaging for flame propagation
- Fuel flow measurement system

### Test Conditions Matrix

| Parameter | Range Tested |
|-----------|-------------|
| Engine Speed | 1500-3000 RPM |
| Load | 25-75% (IMEP) |
| Pilot Injection Ratio | 10-30% |
| Pilot Timing | -60 to -20° ATDC |
| Main Timing | -10 to 10° ATDC |

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

### Thermal Efficiency Improvements

**Optimal Split Injection Configuration**
- Pilot injection: 20% of total mass at -40° ATDC
- Main injection: 80% at -5° ATDC
- Result: ~3-5% thermal efficiency improvement over single injection

**Mechanisms Identified**
- Enhanced turbulence from pilot injection improves mixing
- More complete combustion with reduced wall heat loss
- Better combustion phasing control near TDC

### Combustion Characteristics

**Pressure Trace Analysis**
- Peak cylinder pressure: Reduced by 5-8% with split injection
- Rate of pressure rise: Smoother, reducing mechanical stress
- Combustion duration: Slightly longer but more stable

**Heat Release Analysis**
- Two-stage heat release profile with split injection
- Peak heat release rate: Reduced, benefiting efficiency
- Combustion stability: Improved (lower COV of IMEP)

### NOx Emission Trends

**Observation**: Split injection reduces peak combustion temperature
- Single injection: ~2100K peak temperature
- Optimized split: ~1950K peak temperature  
- NOx reduction: Approximately 15-20%

## Technical Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Injector Response Variation
**Issue**: Cycle-to-cycle variation in pilot injection quantity  
**Mitigation**: Closed-loop control using in-cylinder pressure feedback

### Challenge 2: Hydrogen Embrittlement Concerns
**Issue**: Long-term material degradation in injector components  
**Solution**: Selection of hydrogen-resistant materials, periodic inspection

### Challenge 3: Knock Detection & Control
**Issue**: Hydrogen's low ignition energy increases knock tendency  
**Approach**: Advanced knock detection algorithm, adaptive injection timing

## Future Research Directions

1. **Multi-cylinder engine testing**: Scale findings to production engine
2. **Transient operation**: Investigate split injection under dynamic load
3. **EGR integration**: Combine with exhaust gas recirculation for further NOx reduction
4. **Machine learning optimization**: Use RL to discover optimal injection strategies across operating conditions
