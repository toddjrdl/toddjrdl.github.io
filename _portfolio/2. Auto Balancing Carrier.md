## Overview

Auto Balancing Carrier(ABC) is an intelligent luggage system that automatically maintains horizontal balance and reduces wrist strain when pulling luggage across uneven surfaces like carpets and rough terrain.

## Problem Statement

Traditional luggage systems face critical challenges in real-world usage:

- **Wrist Strain**: Uneven surfaces like carpets and rough terrain require constant force&torque adjustment, causing significant user fatigue
- **Load Imbalance**: Asymmetric weight distribution leads to tipping and instability during transport
- **Manual Adjustment Required**: Users must constantly rebalance heavy loads manually, reducing mobility efficiency

## Our Solution

We developed a hardware-software integrated system combining real-time sensing with reinforcement learning-based control:

### Hardware Components

1. **Multi Load Sensors**: Real-time weight distribution measurement across the carrier platform & handle
2. **Sensor Amplifier**: 6-axis orientation tracking to detect tilting and instability
3. **Actuator**: Motorized system for dynamic weight redistribution, XL430-W250-T used
4. **Synchronized Actuators**: 4 motors connected with gear mechanism for stable 1 output

### Software & Control System

**Reinforcement Learning Training**
- Trained PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and SAC agents in NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Physics-based simulation with terrain randomization (carpet, tiles, inclines)
- Reward shaping optimized for smooth horizontal maintenance

**Sim2Real Transfer**
- Domain randomization across friction coefficients, mass properties, and sensor noise
- System identification for accurate dynamics modeling
- Real-time Arduino deployment with 100Hz control loop
