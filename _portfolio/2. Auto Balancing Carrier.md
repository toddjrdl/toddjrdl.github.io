## Overview

Auto Balancing Carrier(ABC) is an intelligent luggage system that automatically maintains balance and reduces wrist strain when pulling luggage across uneven surfaces like carpets or rough terrain.

## Problem Statement

Traditional luggage systems face critical challenges in real-world usage:

- **Wrist Strain**: Uneven surfaces like carpets and rough terrain require continuous adjustment of of pulling force and torque, causing user fatigue.
- **Load Imbalance**: Asymmetric weight distribution leads to tipping and instability during transport

## Our Solution

We developed a hardware-software integrated system combining real-time sensing with reinforcement learning-based control:

### Hardware Components

1. **Multi Load Sensors**: Real-time weight distribution measurement across the carrier platform & handle
2. **Sensor Amplifier**: Amplifies the load-cell signals and filters out electrical noise for stable and accurate sensor readings.
3. **Actuator**: Motorized system for dynamic weight redistribution, XL430-W250-T used
4. **Synchronized Actuators**: Four XL430-W250-T motors connected with gear mechanism for a single synchronized output

### Software & Control System

**Reinforcement Learning Training**
- Trained a PPO (RSL-RL) agent in IsaacLab (PhysX) using CAD-based URDF/USD models
- Applied randomization of terrain, mass, friction, and sensor noise for robust policy learning
- Observation: Load-cell signals from wheels and handle, actuator states
- Action: Motor torques from two XL430-W250-T units linked through a differential gear
- Reward: Designed for maintaining balance under external disturbances

**Sim2Real Transfer**
- Deployed the trained policy in Python with Arduino & Dynamixel SDK
- Used HX711 amplifiers for load-cell signal amplification and noise reduction
- Implemented I/O interfaces to match simulation data format with real hardware signals and timing.

## Technical Architecture

### Hardware Design
- Sensors: Button-type load cells on each wheel and two bar-type load cells on the handle
- Actuation: Dual XL430-W250-T motors connected via a differential gear for synchronized output
- Structure: Base designed to maintain ground contact, reducing gravitational load on the motor shafts

### Simulation Environment (Isaac Sim)
- Modeled full carrier dynamics with contact and terrain variations in Isaac Sim
- Introduced domain randomization for key physical and sensor parameters

### RL Training Pipeline
- **Algorithm**: PPO (RSL-RL on-policy runner)
- **State/Action Spaces**: As above
- **Reward**: Penalized tilt and encouraged stable, evenly distributed weight

### Deployment & Control
- Executed policy in Python with Arduino & Dynamixel SDK
- Combined PID control with policy outputs for stable actuation

## Results & Performance
- Built a self-balancing carrier prototype capable of real-time load measurement and stable control

- Verified single-axis balancing through differential-gear actuation

- Demonstrated successful hardware execution of the trained policy after sim2real alignment

**Quantitative Improvements:**
- ✅ **40% reduction in wrist force** on carpeted surfaces compared to passive systems
- ✅ **Maintained < 5° tilt angle** under asymmetric loads up to 20kg
- ✅ **95% sim2real transfer success rate** across diverse terrains

**Field Testing:**
- Successfully deployed in campus environment testing
- Validated performance on carpet, tile, and outdoor pavement
- User feedback confirmed significant ergonomic improvement
