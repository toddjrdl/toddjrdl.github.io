## Overview

Research on actuation methods for thick-panel origami structures as part of a Hyundai Motor Company sponsored project at STAR Lab, Seoul National University. This work focuses on enabling practical deployable architecture through direct crease-line actuation and intelligent control strategies.

## Research Motivation

Traditional origami-inspired deployable structures face critical limitations:
- **Thin-sheet assumption**: Classical origami theory assumes zero thickness, impractical for real structures
- **Actuation complexity**: Thick panels require sophisticated actuation at crease lines
- **Deployment planning**: Non-trivial to determine optimal actuation sequences for target shapes
- **Structural integrity**: Thick panels introduce mechanical constraints and potential interference

**Application Domains**
- Deployable shelters and emergency housing
- Transformable automotive components (sponsored by Hyundai)
- Adaptive aerospace structures
- Modular architecture and urban design

## Technical Contributions

### 1. Kinematic Modeling

**Direct Crease-Line Actuation Model**
- Developed geometric framework for thick-panel folding mechanics
- Validated kinematic model enabling hardware-level implementation

**Key Equations & Constraints**
- Panel intersection avoidance conditions
- Crease angle limits based on material properties  
- Spherical mechanism analysis for multi-crease vertices
- Compatibility conditions for global foldability

### 2. Dynamics Modeling

**Time-Dependent Deformation Analysis**
- Modeling structural response during deployment
- Understanding interaction forces between adjacent panels
- Predicting stress concentrations at crease lines
- Accounting for material elasticity and damping

**Current Focus**
- Finite element integration for accurate force prediction
- Contact dynamics at panel interfaces
- Energy dissipation during folding process
- Stability analysis of intermediate configurations

### 3. Reinforcement Learning for Actuation Planning

**Problem Formulation**
- **State Space**: Current crease angles, panel positions, target configuration
- **Action Space**: Continuous actuation commands for each crease actuator
- **Reward**: Progress toward target shape, smoothness, energy efficiency, collision avoidance

**RL Approach**
- Exploring PPO and SAC algorithms for multi-objective optimization
- Curriculum learning: Simple folds â†’ Complex multi-vertex patterns
- Reward shaping for:
  - Target shape achievement (geometric accuracy)
  - Deployment efficiency (minimize time and energy)
  - Safety constraints (collision avoidance, stress limits)

**Expected Advantages**
- Handles complex constraint interactions automatically
- Discovers non-intuitive optimal sequences
- Generalizes across different origami patterns
- Adapts to variations in material properties
