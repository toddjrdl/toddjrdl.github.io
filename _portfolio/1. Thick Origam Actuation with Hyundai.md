## Overview

Research on actuation methods for thick-panel origami structures as part of a Hyundai Motor Company sponsored project at [STAR Lab](https://starlab.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National University. This work focuses on enabling practical deployable architecture through direct crease-line actuation and intelligent control strategies.

## Research Motivation

Traditional origami-inspired deployable structures face limitations:
- **Thin-sheet assumption**: Classical origami theory assumes zero thickness, impractical for real structures
- **Actuation complexity**: Structure used has high DOF, and lots of Bifurcation Points. Non-trivial to determine optimal actuation sequences for target shapes
- **Structural integrity**: Thick panels introduce mechanical constraints and potential interference

**Application Domains**
- Deployable Solar Panels
- Adaptive aerospace structures

## Technical Contributions

### 1. Kinematic Modeling

**Direct Crease-Line Actuation Model**
- Validated kinematic model enabling hardware-level implementation
- Accounts for panel thickness and kinematic constraints
- Enables direct actuation of individual creaselines

**Key Equations & Constraints**
- Unit level kinematic constraints derived by quaternion multiplication & Jacobian matrix
- Full model level kinematic constraints

### 2. Dynamics Modeling

**Time-Dependent Deformation Analysis**
- Modeling structural response during deployment
- Deriving needed torques for each creaseline to actuate structure

### 3. Reinforcement Learning for Actuation Planning

**Problem Formulation**
- **State Space**: Current crease angles, target configuration
- **Action Space**: Continuous actuation commands for each crease actuator
- **Reward**: Progress toward target shape, smoothness, energy efficiency, collision avoidance, symmetric behaviors

**RL Approach**
- Exploring PPO algorithms for multi-objective optimization
- Curriculum learning: Simple folds/opens â†’ Deployment on various terrains
- Reward shaping for:
  - Target shape achievement (geometric accuracy)
  - Deployment efficiency (minimize energy)
  - Safety constraints (avoiding collision and bifurcations)

**Expected Advantages**
- Handles complex constraint interactions automatically
- Discovers non-intuitive optimal sequences
- Generalizes across different origami patterns
