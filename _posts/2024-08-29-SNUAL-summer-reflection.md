This summer, I spent two months at [SNUAL](http://snual.snu.ac.kr/) (Seoul National University Automotive Lab) as an undergraduate research intern. It was my first experience working in an experimental research lab, and while I didn't lead groundbreaking discoveries, I learned invaluable lessons that shaped my research direction.

## What I Actually Did

As an undergrad intern, I wasn't running experiments or designing research protocols. My role was more about **supporting the research process**:

- **Literature review**: Spent countless hours reading papers on hydrogen combustion and studying fundamentals of ICEs. Learned how to quickly extract key insights from dense technical papers.
- **Data analysis**: Processed in-cylinder pressure traces and heat release rate data in MATLAB. Created visualization plots for analysis.
- **Lab work**: Helped with engine disassembly and maintenance. Got my hands dirty (literally) and learned how experimental research actually works at the hardware level.
- **Lab meetings**: Listened to discussions about experimental design and observed how researchers troubleshoot when results don't match expectations.

## The Reality Check

Coming from a mechanical engineering coursework background, I had this romanticized view of experimental research. The reality was different:

**What I expected:** Running exciting experiments, discovering new phenomena, publishable results  
**What I got:** Repetitive maintenance, data that needs careful interpretation, hardware limitations everywhere

But here's the thing—**this was exactly what I needed to experience**.

## Key Lessons

### 1. Experimental Research is *Hard*
When you're modifying a real engine, you can't just change parameters with a few lines of code. Every hardware modification takes time. Sensors fail. Data needs careful validation. The iteration speed is nothing like computational work.

### 2. Supporting Roles Matter
I used to think only the lead researcher's work mattered. Wrong. Literature review guides experimental design. Data analysis reveals patterns. Lab maintenance keeps research moving. Every role in the research ecosystem has value.

### 3. Research Requires Patience
Some experiments took weeks to set up for a few hours of data collection. Results often raised more questions than answers. Progress is nonlinear. This taught me to appreciate the long-term nature of research.

## The Unexpected Outcome

This internship helped me realize something important: **I prefer computational research**.

Not because experimental work is inferior—it's not. But because I found myself more excited about the data analysis in MATLAB than the engine work itself. I kept thinking "what if we used RL to optimize this?" rather than "what if we modified the injector?"

This realization led me to my subsequent internships at DYROS (humanoid robot RL) and STAR Lab (origami actuation with RL)—both heavily computational. Without the SNUAL experience, I might not have discovered this preference.

## What I'd Tell Past Me

If I could go back to June 2024, I'd tell myself:

- **Don't expect to lead research as an undergrad intern.** Your job is to learn and support.
- **Pay attention to what energizes you.** I was more excited about analyzing data than maintaining engines—that's valuable information.
- **Every research experience shapes your path,** even if it shows you what you *don't* want to do.
- **Ask more questions.** The grad students and professors were incredibly knowledgeable; I should have been more curious.

## Moving Forward

While I won't be pursuing experimental engine research, I'm grateful for the SNUAL experience. It gave me:

- Domain knowledge in alternative fuels and sustainable technologies
- Hands-on understanding of experimental methodology
- Respect for the complexity of real-world engineering problems
- Clarity about my research interests

Sometimes the most valuable research experiences are the ones that help you discover what you're truly passionate about. For me, SNUAL was that experience.

*If you're an undergrad considering research, my advice: try different things. You won't know what fits until you experience it. And that's perfectly okay.*
