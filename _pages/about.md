Mechanical Engineering Student at Seoul National University  
Researching in Robotics & Origami-based Structures

What I'm Working On
------
1. RL-based control for humanoid locomotion (sim2real, privileged learning)
1. Thick-origami actuation with Hyundai for deployable structures
1. Robotics that combines materials, geometry, and intelligence

My Vision
------
I’m particularly drawn to problems that sit at the intersection of geometry, control, and learning. Whether it's designing deployable origami surfaces or training bipedal robots to walk with efficiency and grace, I pursue solutions that are as elegant as they are robust. I hope to contribute to robotics systems that are deeply aware of their physical structure and optimized for their task—whether that’s walking, morphing, or adapting.

My Tools / Stack
------
I build my simulations in Isaac Gym and MuJoCo, prototype in Fusion360, and deploy on ROS2 with real sensors. Most of my models are trained in PyTorch, occasionally with hybrid optimization (RL + dynamics-based loss).

Final Station
------
I'm currently applying to graduate programs in robotics and mechanical engineering, especially in fields related to humanoid locomotion and origami-based design.
If you’re working on similar topics or just want to talk about robots that walk and fold, feel free to reach out.
