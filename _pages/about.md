My Research Journey
------
My path to robotics wasn't linear—I explored different domains to discover my true interests. I started with experimental work in H2ICE(Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine) at SNUAL, analyzing hydrogen combustion data and supporting lab operations. This experience revealed my preference for **computational approaches** over hardware-intensive research.

This realization led me to pursue reinforcement learning and robotics at DYROS and STAR Lab, where I found my passion: **designing intelligent systems that understand and exploit their physical structure**. Whether training bipedal robots for adaptive locomotion or optimizing deployable origami mechanisms, I'm drawn to problems at the **intersection of geometry, control, and learning**.


My Vision
------
I pursue solutions that are as **elegant as they are robust**. My goal is to contribute to robotics systems that are deeply aware of their physical structure and optimized for their task; whether that's walking with efficiency, morphing to adapt to environments, or deploying with precision.

My Tools / Stack
------
I build my simulations in **Isaac Gym** and **MuJoCo**, prototype in **Fusion360**, and deploy on **ROS2** with real sensors. Most of my models are trained in **PyTorch**, occasionally with hybrid optimization (RL + dynamics-based loss).

Next Steps
------
I'm currently applying to graduate programs in **robotics and mechanical engineering**, especially in fields related to **locomotion** or **origami-based design**.
